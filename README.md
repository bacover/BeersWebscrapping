BeerAdvocate is an extensive online platform for beer styles, reviews, and scores, but sometimes the filtering available is not everything you are looking for. The following tool allows you to filter results based on a variety of factors to find your next drink easily.

This project was completed using scrapy to scrape the beers from BeerAdvocate. Shiny R was then used to build an interactive session to display the beers.

For more information on the styles of beer, please see here: https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/styles/

For guidelines on how beers are scored and reviewed, please see here: https://www.beeradvocate.com/community/threads/how-to-review-a-beer.241156/ and https://www.beeradvocate.com/community/threads/beeradvocate-ratings-explained.184726/

Beers are listed by their score in descending order.
